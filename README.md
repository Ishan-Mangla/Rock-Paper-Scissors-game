ROCK - PAPER - SCISSORS GAME

This Python script implements a simple command-line Rock Paper & Scissors game between the user and the computer.
The game runs in a loop until the user decides to quit by typing 'Q'. 
The user inputs their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer randomly selects its choice.
